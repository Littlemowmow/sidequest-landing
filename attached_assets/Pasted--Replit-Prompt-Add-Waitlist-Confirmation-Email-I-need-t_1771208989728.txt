# Replit Prompt: Add Waitlist Confirmation Email

I need to add email confirmation when someone signs up for my waitlist. Here's what I need:

## What to build

When a user submits the waitlist form (email, destination, when, group/solo), send them a branded confirmation email automatically.

## Email service

Use **Resend** (resend.com) — it's free for 100 emails/day and dead simple. I'll create an account and add my API key as a Replit secret called `RESEND_API_KEY`.

## The confirmation email should:

- Come from `hello@sidequest.app` (or my Resend test domain until I verify my domain)
- Subject line: "You're on the list 🚀 — SideQuest"
- Be a clean, branded HTML email with:
  - SideQuest logo/name at top
  - "You're in, [first part of email before @]!" as the heading
  - A short message: "You've secured your spot for early access to SideQuest. We're building something special for travelers who want more than tourist traps — and you'll be first to try it."
  - If they provided a destination, include: "We'll make sure [destination] is loaded with hidden gems before you get there."
  - Their unique referral link from the waitlist signup
  - A CTA: "Share with your travel crew" that links to the referral URL
  - Footer: "Questions? Reply to this email." and social links
- Style the email to match the landing page aesthetic — warm dark tones, clean typography, the orange/amber gradient accent color
- Keep it mobile-friendly (most students will open on their phone)

## Backend route

Create an API endpoint (or add to the existing waitlist submission handler) that:
1. Saves the signup to the database (this may already work)
2. Calls Resend's API to send the confirmation email
3. Returns success/failure to the frontend

## Error handling

- If the email fails to send, still save the signup — don't lose the lead
- Log email send failures so I can debug
- Don't send duplicate emails if someone signs up with the same email twice — check for existing signups first

## Important

- Store the Resend API key as a Replit secret, never hardcode it
- The email should NOT look like a generic template — it should feel like it's from a real startup, not a SaaS platform
- Keep the email short — no one reads long signup confirmation emails
