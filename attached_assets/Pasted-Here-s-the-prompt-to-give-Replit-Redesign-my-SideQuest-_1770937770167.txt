Here's the prompt to give Replit:

---

**Redesign my SideQuest landing page. The current version looks like an REI hiking catalogue — sage green, "Find Your True North," nature-documentary energy. That's wrong. SideQuest is a Gen Z travel app that takes trips out of group chat purgatory. The vibe is Pokémon + Red Bull + GoPro + TikTok travel edits. Think: your friend group actually booking that rooftop bar in Barcelona, horseback riding in Mongolia, climbing a volcano in Iceland, not "find your true north together."**

**Brand DNA & Energy:**
- Adventurous but urban AND wild — rooftop bars in Tokyo AND cliff jumping in Croatia AND horseback riding in Mongolia
- Pokémon-esque: collectible experiences, a mascot with personality, gamified discovery
- Red Bull / GoPro energy: bold, action-packed, "you had to be there" moments
- TikTok travel edit aesthetic: fast cuts, bold text, the content Gen Z actually shares
- The energy of your friend saying "guys we HAVE to do this" not a park ranger saying "discover the wild"

**Logo / Mascot:**
- Inspired by Teddiursa from Pokémon — a small adventurous bear character. NOT a realistic bear. Think cute but bold, like a mascot you'd see on a sticker or pin. Round face, crescent moon marking on forehead, big curious eyes, holding a little compass or map. The style should feel like a Pokémon or adventure game character — expressive, slightly chibi proportions, full of personality. Use our brand orange (#FF6B35) as the primary color with dark navy (#0F172A) accents. This mascot should feel like the app's guide/companion, not just a logo.

**Color Palette (use these exact colors):**
- Primary: Electric Orange #FF6B35
- Accent: Electric Crimson #E11D48  
- Action: Vivid Cyan #06B6D4
- Success: Emerald #10B981
- Background: Deep Navy #0F172A and #1E293B
- Text: White and rgba(255,255,255,0.7)
- NO sage green, NO muted earth tones, NO beige

**Typography:**
- Headlines: Something bold and punchy like Dela Gothic One or similar heavy display font
- Body: DM Sans or similar clean sans-serif
- NO serif fonts, NO script/cursive, nothing that looks "elegant" or "serene"

**Page Structure:**

**Section 1 — Hero:**
- Big bold headline. Something like "Don't Let the Trip Die in the Group Chat" or "Stop Talking About It. Actually Go." NOT "Find Your True North Together"
- Subtext that sounds like a friend talking: "Your group chat is full of sick travel ideas that never happen. SideQuest fixes that."
- CTA button: "Join the Waitlist" with orange gradient and glow
- Right side: phone mockup showing the app's discover feed with activity cards (rooftop bars, hidden beaches, street food tours, volcano hikes — NOT just nature/hiking). Cards should show the activity type badges: "SideQuest" (orange), "Local Pick" (cyan), "Tourist Essential" (emerald). Show vote indicators from friends on the cards.
- Animated background: subtle gradient glow movement, grid pattern overlay, dark and bold
- The Teddiursa-inspired bear mascot should appear somewhere in the hero — maybe peeking out, or as part of the logo lockup

**Section 2 — The Problem (keep the iMessage mockup concept, it works):**
- Left side: iMessage group chat mockup showing friends sharing travel inspo that dies in the chat. Messages like "guys we need to go here" / "wait where is that??" / "we should plan something" / then a big red X or "dead" overlay showing the conversation died
- Right side: Bold headline like "Every Trip Starts the Same Way" with subtext about how inspiration dies in group chats. Include stats if possible (like "87% of travel plans shared in group chats never happen" — can be tongue-in-cheek)

**Section 3 — How It Works (3 features):**
- Card 1: "Discover" — We surface the spots your group actually wants to hit. Hidden gems, local secrets, stuff you won't find on page 1 of Google. Icon: compass or map pin
- Card 2: "Squad Vote" — No more "idk what do you guys want to do." Everyone votes, the crew decides together. Icon: thumbs up or checkmark  
- Card 3: "Lock It In" — Turn "we should totally go" into an actual itinerary with dates, times, and a plan. Icon: calendar or lock
- Each card should have a bold icon, punchy copy, and hover animation
- Use terms that feel Gen Z, not corporate

**Section 4 — Activity Categories:**
- Show three content types with big visual cards:
  - "SideQuest" — Hidden gems worth discovering (example: secret speakeasy in Barcelona, volcano hike in Iceland, street food alley in Tokyo)
  - "Local Pick" — What residents actually do (example: the ramen shop with no English menu, the beach only locals know)
  - "Tourist Essential" — The mainstream stuff that's actually worth it (example: Sagrada Familia, but here's how to skip the line)
- Use real-feeling example activities, not generic "explore nature" — think horseback riding in Mongolia, rooftop cinema in London, midnight food tour in Rome

**Section 5 — Destinations:**
- "Coming First To..." with city cards: Barcelona, London, Paris, Rome, Tokyo, Sydney
- Each card has a photo and country flag emoji
- "More cities coming soon →" link
- Keep this section clean, the current version is fine structurally

**Section 6 — Email Capture CTA:**
- Bold headline: "Get Early Access" or "Join the Quest"
- Subtext with urgency/exclusivity
- Email input + "Join" button
- The Teddiursa bear mascot should appear here too — maybe excited/celebrating

**Section 7 — Footer:**
- Simple: logo, social links (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter), copyright
- Dark background

**General Design Rules:**
- Dark mode dominant (navy backgrounds), NOT light/sage/cream
- Orange glows and accent lighting throughout
- Subtle animations: float effects, gradient shifts, hover states with glow
- Cards should have glass-morphism or subtle border glow on hover
- Everything should feel bold, energetic, and young — like a gaming app or hype brand, not a meditation app
- Mobile responsive
- Add subtle grid pattern overlays and radial gradient glows for depth
- The overall feel when someone lands on this page should be "oh this is cool" not "oh this is calming"

That's comprehensive enough for Replit to run with. The key things I'd emphasize if it comes back too tame: push on the Teddiursa mascot being actually Pokémon-styled (not a generic bear icon), the copy sounding like a friend not a brand, and the dark/orange energy over anything green or serene.
