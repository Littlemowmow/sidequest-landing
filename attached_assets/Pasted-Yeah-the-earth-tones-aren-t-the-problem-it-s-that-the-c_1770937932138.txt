Yeah, the earth tones aren't the problem — it's that the current site uses them at full saturation with zero contrast or energy. Earth tones can absolutely go hard. Think about the difference between a beige yoga studio and a National Geographic cover shot of a volcano at golden hour. Same color family, completely different energy.

The trick is pairing warm earth tones with one high-voltage accent that creates tension. Here are three directions to try:

**Option A — "Golden Hour Adventure"** (earth + electric orange)
Keep your deep greens and warm browns but replace sage with richer, deeper tones and let orange do the heavy lifting as the energy color. Think jungle at sunset.
- Background: Deep Forest `#1B2F1F` (rich dark green, not sage)
- Surface: Warm Charcoal `#2A2319` (brown-black, not gray)
- Primary accent: Electric Orange `#FF6B35` (this is your energy)
- Secondary: Amber `#D4940A` (warm gold, not pastel yellow)
- Text: Warm White `#F5F0E8`
- Pop color: Crimson `#E11D48` for badges/alerts

**Option B — "Desert at Night"** (terracotta + cyan)
Warm terracotta and sand tones but against deep dark backgrounds with cyan as the unexpected contrast. Like Morocco meets cyberpunk.
- Background: Deep Earth `#1A1410` (almost black-brown)
- Surface: Dark Clay `#2E2218`
- Primary: Terracotta `#C85A3A` (warmer, earthier than pure orange)
- Secondary: Dusty Sage `#7A8B6F` (muted green that actually works because it's not the whole palette)
- Action: Desert Cyan `#3BBAC2` (the unexpected punch)
- Text: Sand `#E8DFD0`

**Option C — "Volcanic" (my recommendation)**
This is probably your sweet spot. Rich volcanic earth tones — deep blacks, warm ember glows, mossy greens — but the "lava" accent colors bring the Red Bull energy. Nature that's alive and dangerous, not calm and pastoral.
- Background: Obsidian `#141210` (warm black)
- Surface: Volcanic Rock `#262220` 
- Primary: Ember Orange `#E8642D` (slightly more burnt than electric, feels earthier)
- Secondary: Deep Moss `#3D5A3E` (rich forest green, not sage)
- Accent: Lava `#D43D2F` (red-orange glow)
- Highlight: Warm Cyan `#2BA4A4` (teal, not electric — bridges earth and energy)
- Text: Ash White `#EDE8E3`
- Gold: `#C49A2A` for badges/rewards

Option C keeps the nature DNA you like but makes it feel like an adventure, not a spa. The dark volcanic base means your orange accents glow like actual fire instead of looking like a muted accent on sage. And it still works with the Teddiursa mascot and Pokémon energy because Pokémon games are full of these rich environmental palettes.
